# empireRentals

## Overview
  This mock rental store was created using a MySql database.
  To achieve this, we entered all the products into their respected 
  catagories along with quantity, price and implemented a image using
  a URL. 
  
## Challenges 
  During the development of this rental store, we encounted a problem with 
  the population of the page and looked into Sequelize as an alternative. 
  
  Sequelize is a library in Javascript that makes the database easier
  to manage. It is a Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that will map
  an object syntax onto our database schemas. 
 
 ## Future Features
  - Proper checkout page
  - More intuitive way of browsing pages
